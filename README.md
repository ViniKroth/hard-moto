# Problematic
“Petter needs to deliver a lot of packages during the night. The night is long and cold.
Petter just want to get home and watch some Netflix TV Shows. We need help
Petter to achieve his goals as fast and as more reliable as possible. IF Petter chooses
the slow route we would make Petter lose that killer episode, not to mention that he
will be a easy pray for the spoilers. We need build a system(UI is not required but feel free to use Jenkins) in
order to let Petter: Store city information: name, ID, distance. Later on we need to
be able to search for the shortest route from one city to another. The operations must be all online and tail latency should
be small as possible like less than 2 seconds each request..”


# Requisites
- Use diferente machines for Jenkins, Microservice, Redis and Cassandra. 
- Every component should have a dedicated machine.
- Don't use DOCKER.
- Don't use Spring Boot.
- You can use Any Centralized Log / Metrics solution you want - this will be a HUGE plus for you. - You need to have multiple jobs in jenkins.
- You need to have a dedicated MACHINE for Jenkins.
- Don't deploy Microservice in same box as Jenkins. 

# Defined strategy and development
Study first. Do it later.
With the help of the devops-bootcamp-express course, I first studied all the necessary technologies, enhancing my knowledge on a few (eg: Packer, Jenkins), and getting a first look into some unknown grounds (eg: Terraform, AWS).
Afterwards, it was time for the development. Unfortunately, I was not able to accomplish all the required features, mostly in the DevOps area, but even tough a lot was learned

# Accomplished features:
- Microsservice structure
- All endpoints
- Cassandra
- Running on Jetty (Standalone)
- AWS
- Packer

# Room for Improvement:
- Packer -> Complete using
- AWS -> Complete using
- Jenkins -> Use
- Ansible Use
- Terraform -> Use
- Redis-> Use
